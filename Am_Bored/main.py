    This uses the boredapi.com api to get activity suggestions.
    Yes, I made it out of boredom and used a few techniques to build on this rather

    abstract syntax grammar. The abstract syntax itself might change with 
    each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically 
    what the current grammar looks like.
