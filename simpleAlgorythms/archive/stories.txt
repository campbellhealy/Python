For Target being higher than current_guess
    50 - last_guess h
    75 - l
    50 < next_guess < 75

    last_guess < next_guess < current_guess

For Target being lower than current_guess
    50 - last_guess l
    25 - h 
    25 < next_guess < 50

    next_guess  < current_guess <  last_guess


25 - guess

last_guess + guess /2

50
75
500,750, 625, 625 - 750
last guess - max-guess /2

less must be >50 but <75

great than 5
list has 5
guess 7

list 5,7  last guess = 5

sort list
less than 7 but > 5

the guess must be < max_guess but > last_guess
