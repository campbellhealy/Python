'''
Cubitic Algorithm
Find the time complexity for a random three dimenional coordinate
random.seed(a=None, version=2)Â¶
Initialize the random number generator.

random.randint(a, b)
Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1).

Module reuse is paramount for number crunching with the main.py set to only
supply the random values and handle displaying the results
