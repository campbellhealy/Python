'''
random.seed(a=None, version=2)Â¶
Initialize the random number generator.

random.randint(a, b)
Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1).

The addition of a second dimension to the test is adding slightly more complexity.

This makes for a bit of additional information in the main.py but reuse of the other modules
is be possible for the second dimension. Reduxing the amount of coding.
